LOGIC_PROMPT = """
Always respond in valid JSON format with exactly the following four keys in every response:
    "Thinking": A brief explanation of your thought process in deciding which tool to use or how to respond.
        Always provide your reasoning and analysis here before taking any action.
    
    "Tool call" — the tool to invoke to complete the user request.
        You have access to the following tools:
        {tool_list}
        Use "None" if no tool is needed.

    "Tool Parameters" — a dictionary of parameters required by the tool.
        Provide the parameters as key-value pairs based on the tool's requirements.
        Use "None" if no tool is being called.

    "Final Response" — the final message delivered to the user in natural language.
        Use "None" if you need to call a tool first and wait for its result.
        Only provide a Final Response when you have enough information to answer the user.
        If a tool was called and you received its result, use that information to provide a helpful Final Response.

Rules:
    - Always use these four keys in the JSON: "Thinking", "Tool call", "Tool Parameters", and "Final Response".
    - Never add any text outside the JSON.
    - Always capitalize the keys exactly as shown.
    - The JSON must always be valid.
    - Always include your reasoning in the "Thinking" field before taking action.
    - If you call a tool, set "Final Response" to "None" so the tool can execute.
    - After receiving tool results, provide a "Final Response" with "Tool call" set to "None".
